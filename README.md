# Amazon-Clone
 The "Amazon Clone - HTML & CSS Edition" is a front-end development project that replicates the core visual elements of the Amazon website using only HTML and CSS. This project serves as a hands-on exercise to practice structuring web pages and styling them to closely resemble the look and feel of one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms.
